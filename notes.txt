== Key Classes
=======================================

A few classes that are helpful to know about when getting started.
The focus is on classes that are not necessarily obvious when tracing
code.

== Security and URLs
=======================================

Current thoughts on urls and security...

For improved security, browsers generally prohibit javascript 
from making requests to any host other than the one that 
served the page in the first place.  This is generally referred
to as the "same origin policy."

The Same Origin Policy even disallows requests across subdomains.
E.g.: the following pages cannot access each other:
    sub1.domain.com
    sub2.domain.com
    
On the other hand, cookies CAN be shared across sub-domains.
This may not be the default, and may require setting an explicit
parameter when setting the cookie. 

So... thoughts on urls...

We are moving towards greater emphasis on consumer facing 
applications, and this is driving increased emphasis on 
product marketing.  For a variety of reasons, it is important 
to keep the hosting for the marketing site and the application
site separate.  These sites are maintained by different 
people with different skills and different tools.

The intent is to use the same _domain_ for both the marketing
site and the application site, but to split them across 
different subdomains.  E.g.:
    marketing:   www.mydomain.com
    application: app.mydomain.com

The Same Origin Policy will still prevent javascript from 
making requests across the subdomains.  However, we can 
share cookies between the subdomains and this will simplify
a variety of cases.  Assuming the marketing site has already
created a pertinent cookie (e.g.: an affiliate), then the
marketing site can pass control to the application with a 
simple url, and the application can then pull the affiliate
code directly out of the original cookie.

I included this a while back.  Why?
For now, I am removing it until I an rediscover why.

    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    
    This option basically forces IE to use the latest rendering engine
        rather than respecting the typical versioning mechanism.
        Perhaps a simpler, though less reliable, way of coding an html
        page for cross browser compatibility.

=======================================
== Javascript
=======================================

$('document').ready(someFunction);

    Run some function when the DOM is ready.
    Does not wait for all resources (e.g.: images) to be loaded.
    
    
$('window').load(someFunction);

    Run some function when the entire window has been loaded.
    Waits for all resources (e.g.: images) to be loaded.


function removeBodyChildren()
{
    var b = document.body;
    while ( b.hasChildNodes() )
        b.removeChild(b.firstChild);
}


var forceReload = true;    
window.location.reload(forceReload);

=======================================
== css
=======================================

min-width: 75px;
width: expression(this.width < 75 ? 75: true);
            
font: italic bold 14px sans-serif
    
=======================================
== java
=======================================

    ScReplaceContentsScript r;
    r = ajax().replaceContents();
    r.setOuterSelector("#layoutCenter");
    r.setInnerSelector("#layoutCenter");
    r.setContents(e);

== concepts / glossary
=======================================
    
flavor
    Alternate ui formats for an individual control.  For example,
    a group may have multiple flavors for things like: normal, warning,
    error, nested.  When controls have multiple flavors, those flavors 
    are all listed inside the .css file.
    
theme
    Alternate ui formats that apply to the entire application.  Switching
    the theme can affect nearly everything and requires a parallel definition
    of all web resources.  We have partial support for multiple themes, but
    the implementation is not complete.  Currently the application uses a 
    single, "default", theme.
      
=======================================
== css
=======================================

Class names that contain one or two dashes are interpreted by the 
code generator as composites.  The two accepted formats are:

    prefix-part-theme
    prefix-part

In the second format, the system will generate a "default" theme
with a null value.

This syntax allows us to auto-generate consistent css constants
rather than relying on fragile string literals.  For example, 
suppose we use a group box that contains a header, body, and 
footer; and that has different themes for normal and alert.  The
.css file may contain selectors like:

    group-header-normal
    group-body-normal
    group-footer-normal
    
    group-header-alert
    group-body-alert
    group-footer-alert
    
The code generator will then create fully named constants like:

    group_header_normal = "group-header-normal";
    group_body_normal   = "group-body-normal"; 
    ...

But since the css classes match the composite pattern additional 
constants will be generated like:

    group_prefix        = "group";
    group_part_header   = "header";
    group_part_body     = "body";
    group_part_footer   = "footer";
    group_theme_normal  = "normal";
    group_theme_alert   = "alert";
    
This pattern is not fool-proof, but is expected to significantly 
reduces the accidental disconnects between .css files and java
string literals.
      
=======================================
== common class prefixes
=======================================

We use various prefixes at the beginning of our class names. A few
of the common prefixes are:

    My - Used for local application specific files.
    Km - Used for the majority of the KodeMore open source library.
    Sc - Used for the Servlet Control library.
