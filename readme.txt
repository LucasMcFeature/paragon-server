Purpose:

    This repository is intended to provide a sandbox for developing
    samples of the functionality that we can build with new "HTML 5" 
    apps.

    AccuCode Inc has allowed this entire project to be licenced as
    open source under the MIT License.  This is primarily done to
    encourage key development staff to contribute to the library
    during non-business hours.
    
    Because this project is developed as open source, every effort
    must be made to avoid including anything that would violate the
    ability to bundle and distribute this project under the license.

    is intended to be bundled under the same license.  Any exceptions
    should be clearly identified.
